Review season is approaching, as it always is. Peer reviews, self
reviews, upward reviews, quarterly reviews, and yearly reviews, need to
be written, read, and relayed. For some, this is a much-appreciated time
to celebrate your co-workers, give constructive feedback, learn how you
can grow yourself, and (hopefully) get confirmation that overall you're
doing a good job. For many, it's a time of endless feedback-writing,
filling out form after form with the same couple of prompts, trying to
remember what happened even just a few weeks ago and what working with a
given person was like two months ago, and either trying to not sound
like an ass when pointing out areas for improvement or glossing over any
larger problems altogether.

I've come to realise that many despise writing reviews. Not necessarily
because they don't see their importance, but because they dislike the
process, struggle to write something they see as *useful*, and feel like
it quickly gets repetitive. I've had those thoughts too. But the more
I'm part of people and performance conversations, whether through
mentoring, being a people lead, or being part of technical leadership,
the more I see just how vital reviews truly are to both the individual
and the organisation. So, I want to talk about how I write about people,
to people.

# A human will read what you write -- write like it

People reviews are, inherently, *for people*. The review doesn't go into
a machine that spits out a number on the other end (and hopefully we
never end up in such a world), nor is it expected to represent a formal
argument for submission to some academic journal or a checklist for
someone to tick off. It will be read by the person it's about, by that
person's lead, used as part of an argument to other people further up
"the chain", or some combination of the above. All of those people have
their own feelings and opinions, and your goal isn't to impose your
views onto them, but rather to supply your perspective and experience to
augment theirs.

This has two primary implications for how you write reviews:

1.  **Write with compassion.** You can write the most accurate and
    insightful review in the world, but fail to get any of it across
    because the reader cannot get past the *way* you have written it.
    Phrasing matters. You should still [say the hard thing(s)] without
    [burying the lede], but take the time to find the right framing. A
    useful [litmus test] here whether, if you received the same
    feedback, you would actually consider what was being said or brush
    it off as "just this person's unfounded criticism". Concretely, I'd
    recommend brushing up on the [fundamental attribution error] and
    [avoiding words like "always" and "never"].

2.  **Make it actionable.** Praise is nice, critique is unpleasant, and
    neither is all that *useful*. In the spirit of "write what you'd
    want to receive", prefer highlighting specific things that the
    person in question could *do something about*. This can be stuff
    already do that they should double down on or pare back, or it could
    be things they're not currently doing that would make them more
    impactful if they did. If someone reads your review and still
    wonders afterwards "so what are they good at?" or "but how could
    this person do better[?",][hacker-style] you have failed to get your
    message across.

# Spend the time to make it short

The more you write, the less attention each words gets. Thus, if you
want your feedback to not just be glossed over, you have to polish the
text down such that only the most important bits remain. My
recommendation is that you limit your answer to any one prompt on any
feedback form to a paragraph and a half or three bullet points of at
most two sentences each. Any longer and you risk that the reader will
miss at least some part of what you've written. It may be frustrating,
but it is reality.

My process is usually to first do a brain-dump with no length
constraints, then to take a pass over the dump where I group related
feedback into short paragraphs of full sentences, and then to take a
second pass where I aggressively cut each such paragraph to half the
length. This leaves you with a decent first draft that you can hone down
into the final review.

# Two take-aways is too many

What do you remember of the last review you received? Do you remember
concretely what learnings or advice you took away from it? Reviews, like
much of the content we consume (what do you remember of the last
presentation you watched?), disappears into some black hole in our
brains, never to be recalled again. This is partially related to the
length of the content -- I know if I'm given a single page of
information, I'll be lucky if we remember a fraction of what was on it
even a week later. But much of it comes down to information overload. If
the entire text on that single page served to make a single point like,
say, "deer are the worst animal", I'd be much more likely to remember
that one point a week later!

Reviews work the same way. If you want the reader to remember the
feedback you've given, whether positive or negative, you need to give
less of it. Much less. My rule of thumb is that humans usually remember
(at most) one big and one small thing from any given piece of content
they're presented with. And worse yet, the scaling is negative beyond
that point: if you make three points, the recipient will probably
remember only one. If you make four, they'll remember nothing.

Concretely, this means that when you're writing reviews, you'll usually
get a lot further in terms of helping the other person by presenting one
main thing they do really well or would benefit significantly from
improving upon, and one smaller thing that you appreciate or think is
getting in their way. That's all you get, no matter how much you'd like
to list out the twelve reasons they're excellent or the dozen things
that are holding them back.

Getting down to the most impactful 1.5 points to raise, you guessed it,
takes time and effort. You'll usually want to take the set of *all*
things you'd want to include and look for patterns in them. Then look
for patterns in the patterns. Distil the points until any further
generalisation would make them useless, and then pick the one you think
is *most* important to convey. Then pick one to mention with just a
couple of sentences at the end (see where I got a paragraph and a half
from?). File the rest away as feedback you might give next time around
-- including them, no matter how tempting, is very likely to be
counter-productive.

> than a point and a half.
