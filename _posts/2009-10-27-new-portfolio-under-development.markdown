As some of you may have noticed, my current portfolio is, mildly speaking, lacking a proper design ( http://thesquareplanet.com ). Over the last couple of days I have decided to do something about this, and have started to build several prototypes of a new design..

After discarding quite a few, I have finally arrived at one that I believe is starting to look good. You can see the prototype at http://jon.thesquareplanet.com/proto.

I would really like some feedback on this design, as I have never been much of a designer.. Code is my thing, not pictures.. ;)
