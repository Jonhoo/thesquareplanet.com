I have been working with computers and software development for about six years, mostly web based, but also desktop applications.

My primary language is PHP, supplied by XHTML/CSS/Javascript and PostgreSQL, though I have also used:
<ul>
	<li>Perl - Minor scripts for solving specific problems. Some early web work</li>
	<li>C(++) - Wrote an XOR file encrypter, though it was soon deemed insecure. Good experience though.</li>
	<li>Java - Studied Java for a year in university, and can handle most common tasks.</li>
	<li>Python - Written a synchronisation program for FTP/local sync, as well as some other minor projects.</li>
</ul>
With PHP I have written both free-style, as well as using libraries like CakePHP and Yii.

For Javascript I mostly use jQuery as it is both very flexible, fast and extensive.
