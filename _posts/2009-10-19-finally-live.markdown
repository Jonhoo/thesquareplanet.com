My first completely self-produced website has now been released to the public!

The page is for a summer camp for children in Norway, and can be seen at http://oksnoen.no
It allows for word-like editing of the pages for the administrators, and will hopefully soon include a home-grown gallery software that will also be released later as an independent open-source PHP project.

The site is developed in PHP and flat files/xml, and supports UTF-8, as well as dynamic page inclusion ( i.e. a page can be set up by the admins to include another site - such as a PHP form ). Furthermore, it also features different color schemes for each section, by using a PHP-powered stylesheet.

The code for this page is also quite flexible, and can in theory also be utilized for any similarly structured site ( frontpage and several different sections with subpages ). If you are interested in something like this, feel free to get in touch.
