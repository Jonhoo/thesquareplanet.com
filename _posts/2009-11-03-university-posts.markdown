You may notice that every now and then there appears a post that seems forced, or not in line with the kinds of posts I usually make such as the [Javascript and DOM references](http://jonhoo.wordpress.com/2009/10/19/javascript-and-dom-references/) post. This is because one of my university courses at Bond University is running a Blog Assessment in which we are given certain topics to blog about every now and then. Since these assignments are compulsory, I cannot refrain from writing them though they clutter the rest of the blog entries. 

Oh well, just thought I would explain the issue for those who are confused by these seemingly random posts.
