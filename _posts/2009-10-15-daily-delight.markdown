As any proper geek, I am quite fond of comics, and especially those related to mathematics, computers, dry humor and sarcasm. Although I follow several different stripes, there is one in particular that is almost always to my taste: xkcd. xkcd is, according to the [site](http://xkcd.org), "A webcomic of romance, sarcasm, love and language", but also sports some computer-related stripes.

Today, I came over quite a good one:

I urge you to walk backwards through the history of stripes as well, there are plenty of laughs to be had!

Another quite good comic strip I just came across is kopozky.net:
