		I am a PhD student in the Parallel and
		Distributed Operating Systems group at MIT <abbr
		title="Computer Science &amp; Artificial Intelligence Laboratory">CSAIL</abbr>,
		supervised by
		<a href="http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/rtm/">Robert Morris</a>.

		Before I started MIT, I received an MSc in Networked Computer
		Systems from
		<a href="https://ucl.ac.uk"><abbr title="University College London">UCL</abbr></a>
		in the UK, and a BSc in Information Technology
		from <a href="http://bond.edu.au">Bond University</a>
		in Australia.

		I do live-coding sessions and various open-source work which
		you can find on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/jonhoo">Patreon</a>
		and <a href="https://github.com/jonhoo">GitHub</a>. Over the
		past few years, I've been doing research on a new database
		engine written in Rust which you can find along other recent
		projects on the <a href="research/">research page</a>.
		Occasionally I <a href="blog/">write at length</a> about things
		I find interesting.
