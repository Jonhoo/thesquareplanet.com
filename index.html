		I am a PhD student in the Parallel and
		Distributed Operating Systems group at MIT <abbr
		title="Computer Science &amp; Artificial Intelligence Laboratory">CSAIL</abbr>,
		supervised by
		<a href="http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/rtm/">Robert Morris</a>.

		Before going to MIT, I received an MSc in
		Networked Computer Systems from
		<a href="https://ucl.ac.uk"><abbr title="University College London">UCL</abbr></a>
		in the UK, and a BSc in Information Technology
		from <a href="http://bond.edu.au">Bond University</a>
		in Australia.

	<p>
		I do <a href="portfolio.html">web development</a>
		on the side when I have the time, and hack on
		various other <a href="research.html#projects">projects</a>.
		I like dabbling in programming languages, and
		have worked with C/C++, Haskell, JavaScript
		(NodeJS &amp; browser), PHP, Perl, Python,
		Shell and Go over the years.
