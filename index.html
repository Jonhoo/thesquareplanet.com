		Hello! I'm currently working as a software engineer at
		<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a>. Before that, I was a
		PhD student in the Parallel and Distributed Operating Systems
		group at MIT CSAIL, where I was supervised by
		<a href="http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/rtm/">Robert Morris</a>
		in my work on
		<a href="https://jon.thesquareplanet.com/papers/phd-thesis.pdf">Noria</a>.

		Before I started MIT, I received an MSc in Networked Computer
		Systems from <a href="https://ucl.ac.uk">UCL</a> in the UK, and
		a BSc in Information Technology from
		<a href="http://bond.edu.au">Bond University</a> in Australia.
	</p>

		I do live-coding sessions and various open-source work which
		you can find on
		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/JonGjengset">YouTube</a>,
		<a href="https://github.com/jonhoo">GitHub</a>, and
		<a href="https://twitter.com/jonhoo">Twitter</a>. Over the past
		few years, I've been doing research on a new database engine
		written in Rust which you can find along other recent projects
		on the <a href="research/">research page</a>. Occasionally I
		<a href="blog/">write at length</a> about things I find
		interesting.
